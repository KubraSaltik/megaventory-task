# megaventory-task
The project made in .Net Core and C# has been used as programming language. First of all the structure of project (wich contains; controllers, serviceses and dtos(data transfer object)) has been created. Dtos represent data's form in megaventory api's. In every service I create a funtion and this function post a request to the megaventory api.
I have created similar apis before in .Net Core but I have never send a request to another api.
